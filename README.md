### Hi there, I'm [Adrian][website] 👋

- 🎓 I have a MSc in Computer Science from University of Tromsø with graduation in 2015
- 💼 I run a software development company together with [Øystein Langseth][website-oysteinlangseth] doing consulting/contracting as well as internal projects
- 🌐 Our company is named [Oeto][website-oeto]
- 🌱 I’m thriving when I can combine my deep technological interest with my passion for innovation and product creation! I can’t resist getting involved in most parts of the pipeline - from UI/UX to cloud solution architecture to business related aspects.
